## Universal Management and Printing Tool

A universal management system and printing tool has an initiative of making a moral impact on management systems. Management systems are necessary for a person or an organization to maintain their current workings and future goals. We must reduce our efforts on maintaining our daily expenses or bills to a note book like old ages. It’s the era of technology and computer so let’s enjoy the shiny day with clouds every day and leave the rest to a computer.

## Objectives and Goal

The main theme of a universal management system is to work with any kind of management work. Let’s describe what my project is trying to achieve and explain why I am pursuing it:
•Reduce efforts on managing things like old days with a pen and paper.
• Save time on managing things.
• Using computer is not hard to manage things.
• Never lost a paper of your costing and notes of important things.
•Have a few clicks and get your work done within a second.
•Print it and take it with you just like old days.
•Lost the printed copy and cry. No, that’s not going to happen. Always have a backup file in your computer and hang around tension free.

I hope this project will help a lot of people to manage various things in various fields. Demo project is just for demonstration and doesn’t mean the you can only use the project for toll management system. You can use it for personal note taking, A small business start-up, in a general store or in a pharmacy. This project also gives you the facility to store your data so that you can use it any further. In a nutshell, It’s not a fancy project after all. It’s just a basic project to help people with their daily life management and printing various things with a minimal software.
